# Install

## Shared Hosts

- First of all it's highly important that you check if the version of php is PHP >= 5.4
and also you have "MCrypt PHP Extension" installed already, since sometimes you'll get
irelecant errors

- If there's a CPANEL aviable and has a feature of creating sub-domains
point the sub-domain root folder to the `/public` directory of the app, such as:
`/www/myapp/public/`.
NOTE: a .htaccess file that redirects to `/public` directory wouldn't be a good 
solution, since in my case it was trying to find the routes by the `/public` folder
such as: `/public/app`...
