The settlement acknowledges that we quickly changed the service to address  
users' concerns. In addition, Google has committed $8.5 million to an  
independent fund, most of which will support organizations promoting  
privacy education and policy on the web. We will also do more to educate  
people about privacy controls specific to Buzz. The more people know about  
privacy online, the better their online experience will be.

Just to be clear, this is not a settlement in which people who use Gmail  
can file to receive compensation. Everyone in the U.S. who uses Gmail is  
included in the settlement, unless you personally decide to opt out before  
December 6, 2010. The Court will consider final approval of the agreement  
on January 31, 2011. This email is a summary of the settlement, and more  
detailed information and instructions approved by the court, including  
instructions about how to opt out, object, or comment, are available at  
http://www.BuzzClassAction.com.

This mandatory announcement was sent to all Gmail users in the United  
States as part of a legal settlement and was authorized by the United

 Conversation view
Gmail groups emails and their replies in your inbox, so you always see your

The settlement acknowledges that we quickly changed the service to address  
users' concerns. In addition, Google has committed $8.5 million to an  
independent fund, most of which will support organizations promoting  
privacy education and policy on the web. We will also do more to educate  
people about privacy controls specific to Buzz. The more people know about  
privacy online, the better their online experience will be.

Just to be clear, this is not a settlement in which people who use Gmail  
can file to receive compensation. Everyone in the U.S. who uses Gmail is  
included in the settlement, unless you personally decide to opt out before  
December 6, 2010. The Court will consider final approval of the agreement  
on January 31, 2011. This email is a summary of the settlement, and more  
detailed information and instructions approved by the court, including  
instructions about how to opt out, object, or comment, are available at  
http://www.BuzzClassAction.com.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
This mandatory announcement was sent to all Gmail users in the United  
States as part of a legal settlement and was authorized by the United  
States District Court for the Northern District of California.
