"Google rarely contacts Gmail users via email, but we are making an  \r\nexception to let you know that we've reached a settlement in a lawsuit  \r\nregarding Google Buzz (http:\/\/buzz.google.com), a service we launched  \r\nwithin Gmail in February of this year.\r\n\r\nShortly after its launch, we heard from a number of people who were  \r\nconcerned about privacy. In addition, we were sued by a group of Buzz users  \r\nand recently reached a settlement in this case.\r\n\r\nThe settlement acknowledges that we quickly changed the service to address  \r\nusers' concerns. In addition, Google has committed $8.5 million to an  \r\nindependent fund, most of which will support organizations promoting  \r\nprivacy education and policy on the web. We will also do more to educate  \r\npeople about privacy controls specific to Buzz. The more people know about  \r\nprivacy online, the better their online experience will be.\r\n\r\nJust to be clear, this is not a settlement in which people who use Gmail  \r\ncan file to receive compensation. Everyone in the U.S. who uses Gmail is  \r\nincluded in the settlement, unless you personally decide to opt out before  \r\nDecember 6, 2010. The Court will consider final approval of the agreement  \r\non January 31, 2011. This email is a summary of the settlement, and more  \r\ndetailed information and instructions approved by the court, including  \r\ninstructions about how to opt out, object, or comment, are available at  \r\nhttp:\/\/www.BuzzClassAction.com.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThis mandatory announcement was sent to all Gmail users in the United  \r\nStates as part of a legal settlement and was authorized by the United  \r\nStates District Court for the Northern District of California.\r\n\r\nGoogle Inc. | 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway | Mountain View, CA 94043"

"Google rarely contacts Gmail users via email, but we are making an  \r\nexception to let you know that we've reached a settlement in a lawsuit  \r\nregarding Google Buzz (http:\/\/buzz.google.com), a service we launched  \r\nwithin Gmail in February of this year.\r\n\r\nShortly after its launch, we heard from a number of people who were  \r\nconcerned about privacy. In addition, we were sued by a group of Buzz users  \r\nand recently reached a settlement in this case.\r\n\r\nThe settlement acknowledges that we quickly changed the service to address  \r\nusers' concerns. In addition, Google has committed $8.5 million to an  \r\nindependent fund, most of which will support organizations promoting  \r\nprivacy education and policy on the web. We will also do more to educate  \r\npeople about privacy controls specific to Buzz. The more people know about  \r\nprivacy online, the better their online experience will be.\r\n\r\nJust to be clear, this is not a settlement in which people who use Gmail  \r\ncan file to receive compensation. Everyone in the U.S. who uses Gmail is  \r\nincluded in the settlement, unless you personally decide to opt out before  \r\nDecember 6, 2010. The Court will consider final approval of the agreement  \r\non January 31, 2011. This email is a summary of the settlement, and more  \r\ndetailed information and instructions approved by the court, including  \r\ninstructions about how to opt out, object, or comment, are available at  \r\nhttp:\/\/www.BuzzClassAction.com.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThis mandatory announcement was sent to all Gmail users in the United  \r\nStates as part of a legal settlement and was authorized by the United  \r\nStates District Court for the Northern District of California.\r\n\r\nGoogle Inc. | 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway | Mountain View, CA 94043"

"Google rarely contacts Gmail users via email, but we are making an  \r\nexception to let you know that we've reached a settlement in a lawsuit  \r\nregarding Google Buzz (http:\/\/buzz.google.com), a service we launched  \r\nwithin Gmail in February of this year.\r\n\r\nShortly after its launch, we heard from a number of people who were  \r\nconcerned about privacy. In addition, we were sued by a group of Buzz users  \r\nand recently reached a settlement in this case.\r\n\r\nThe settlement acknowledges that we quickly changed the service to address  \r\nusers' concerns. In addition, Google has committed $8.5 million to an  \r\nindependent fund, most of which will support organizations promoting  \r\nprivacy education and policy on the web. We will also do more to educate  \r\npeople about privacy controls specific to Buzz. The more people know about  \r\nprivacy online, the better their online experience will be.\r\n\r\nJust to be clear, this is not a settlement in which people who use Gmail  \r\ncan file to receive compensation. Everyone in the U.S. who uses Gmail is  \r\nincluded in the settlement, unless you personally decide to opt out before  \r\nDecember 6, 2010. The Court will consider final approval of the agreement  \r\non January 31, 2011. This email is a summary of the settlement, and more  \r\ndetailed information and instructions approved by the court, including  \r\ninstructions about how to opt out, object, or comment, are available at  \r\nhttp:\/\/www.BuzzClassAction.com.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThis mandatory announcement was sent to all Gmail users in the United  \r\nStates as part of a legal settlement and was authorized by the United  \r\nStates District Court for the Northern District of California.\r\n\r\nGoogle Inc. | 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway | Mountain View, CA 94043"

"Google rarely contacts Gmail users via email, but we are making an  \r\nexception to let you know that we've reached a settlement in a lawsuit  \r\nregarding Google Buzz (http:\/\/buzz.google.com), a service we launched  \r\nwithin Gmail in February of this year.\r\n\r\nShortly after its launch, we heard from a number of people who were  \r\nconcerned about privacy. In addition, we were sued by a group of Buzz users  \r\nand recently reached a settlement in this case.\r\n\r\nThe settlement acknowledges that we quickly changed the service to address  \r\nusers' concerns. In addition, Google has committed $8.5 million to an  \r\nindependent fund, most of which will support organizations promoting  \r\nprivacy education and policy on the web. We will also do more to educate  \r\npeople about privacy controls specific to Buzz. The more people know about  \r\nprivacy online, the better their online experience will be.\r\n\r\nJust to be clear, this is not a settlement in which people who use Gmail  \r\ncan file to receive compensation. Everyone in the U.S. who uses Gmail is  \r\nincluded in the settlement, unless you personally decide to opt out before  \r\nDecember 6, 2010. The Court will consider final approval of the agreement  \r\non January 31, 2011. This email is a summary of the settlement, and more  \r\ndetailed information and instructions approved by the court, including  \r\ninstructions about how to opt out, object, or comment, are available at  \r\nhttp:\/\/www.BuzzClassAction.com.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThis mandatory announcement was sent to all Gmail users in the United  \r\nStates as part of a legal settlement and was authorized by the United  \r\nStates District Court for the Northern District of California.\r\n\r\nGoogle Inc. | 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway | Mountain View, CA 94043"

"Google rarely contacts Gmail users via email, but we are making an  \r\nexception to let you know that we've reached a settlement in a lawsuit  \r\nregarding Google Buzz (http:\/\/buzz.google.com), a service we launched  \r\nwithin Gmail in February of this year.\r\n\r\nShortly after its launch, we heard from a number of people who were  \r\nconcerned about privacy. In addition, we were sued by a group of Buzz users  \r\nand recently reached a settlement in this case.\r\n\r\nThe settlement acknowledges that we quickly changed the service to address  \r\nusers' concerns. In addition, Google has committed $8.5 million to an  \r\nindependent fund, most of which will support organizations promoting  \r\nprivacy education and policy on the web. We will also do more to educate  \r\npeople about privacy controls specific to Buzz. The more people know about  \r\nprivacy online, the better their online experience will be.\r\n\r\nJust to be clear, this is not a settlement in which people who use Gmail  \r\ncan file to receive compensation. Everyone in the U.S. who uses Gmail is  \r\nincluded in the settlement, unless you personally decide to opt out before  \r\nDecember 6, 2010. The Court will consider final approval of the agreement  \r\non January 31, 2011. This email is a summary of the settlement, and more  \r\ndetailed information and instructions approved by the court, including  \r\ninstructions about how to opt out, object, or comment, are available at  \r\nhttp:\/\/www.BuzzClassAction.com.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThis mandatory announcement was sent to all Gmail users in the United  \r\nStates as part of a legal settlement and was authorized by the United  \r\nStates District Court for the Northern District of California.\r\n\r\nGoogle Inc. | 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway | Mountain View, CA 94043"

"Google rarely contacts Gmail users via email, but we are making an  \r\nexception to let you know that we've reached a settlement in a lawsuit  \r\nregarding Google Buzz (http:\/\/buzz.google.com), a service we launched  \r\nwithin Gmail in February of this year.\r\n\r\nShortly after its launch, we heard from a number of people who were  \r\nconcerned about privacy. In addition, we were sued by a group of Buzz users  \r\nand recently reached a settlement in this case.\r\n\r\nThe settlement acknowledges that we quickly changed the service to address  \r\nusers' concerns. In addition, Google has committed $8.5 million to an  \r\nindependent fund, most of which will support organizations promoting  \r\nprivacy education and policy on the web. We will also do more to educate  \r\npeople about privacy controls specific to Buzz. The more people know about  \r\nprivacy online, the better their online experience will be.\r\n\r\nJust to be clear, this is not a settlement in which people who use Gmail  \r\ncan file to receive compensation. Everyone in the U.S. who uses Gmail is  \r\nincluded in the settlement, unless you personally decide to opt out before  \r\nDecember 6, 2010. The Court will consider final approval of the agreement  \r\non January 31, 2011. This email is a summary of the settlement, and more  \r\ndetailed information and instructions approved by the court, including  \r\ninstructions about how to opt out, object, or comment, are available at  \r\nhttp:\/\/www.BuzzClassAction.com.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThis mandatory announcement was sent to all Gmail users in the United  \r\nStates as part of a legal settlement and was authorized by the United  \r\nStates District Court for the Northern District of California.\r\n\r\nGoogle Inc. | 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway | Mountain View, CA 94043"
