The settlement acknowledges that we quickly changed the service to address  
users' concerns. In addition, Google has committed $8.5 million to an  
independent fund, most of which will support organizations promoting  
privacy education and policy on the web. We will also do more to educate  
people about privacy controls specific to Buzz. The more people know about  
privacy online, the better their online experience will be.

Just to be clear, this is not a settlement in which people who use Gmail  
can file to receive compensation. Everyone in the U.S. who uses Gmail is  
included in the settlement, unless you personally decide to opt out before  
December 6, 2010. The Court will consider final approval of the agreement  
on January 31, 2011. This email is a summary of the settlement, and more  
detailed information and instructions approved by the court, including  
instructions about how to opt out, object, or comment, are available at  
http://www.BuzzClassAction.com.

This mandatory announcement was sent to all Gmail users in the United  
States as part of a legal settlement and was authorized by the United

- The Gmail Team

The settlement acknowledges that we quickly changed the service to address  
users' concerns. In addition, Google has committed $8.5 million to an  
independent fund, most of which will support organizations promoting  
privacy education and policy on the web. We will also do more to educate  
people about privacy controls specific to Buzz. The more people know about  
privacy online, the better their online experience will be.

Just to be clear, this is not a settlement in which people who use Gmail  
can file to receive compensation. Everyone in the U.S. who uses Gmail is  
included in the settlement, unless you personally decide to opt out before  
December 6, 2010. The Court will consider final approval of the agreement  
on January 31, 2011. This email is a summary of the settlement, and more  
detailed information and instructions approved by the court, including  
instructions about how to opt out, object, or comment, are available at  
http://www.BuzzClassAction.com.

This mandatory announcement was sent to all Gmail users in the United  
States as part of a legal settlement and was authorized by the United

Welcome!

- The Gmail Team

The settlement acknowledges that we quickly changed the service to address  
users' concerns. In addition, Google has committed $8.5 million to an  
independent fund, most of which will support organizations promoting  
privacy education and policy on the web. We will also do more to educate  
people about privacy controls specific to Buzz. The more people know about  
privacy online, the better their online experience will be.

Just to be clear, this is not a settlement in which people who use Gmail  
can file to receive compensation. Everyone in the U.S. who uses Gmail is  
included in the settlement, unless you personally decide to opt out before  
December 6, 2010. The Court will consider final approval of the agreement  
on January 31, 2011. This email is a summary of the settlement, and more  
detailed information and instructions approved by the court, including  
instructions about how to opt out, object, or comment, are available at  
http://www.BuzzClassAction.com.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
This mandatory announcement was sent to all Gmail users in the United  
States as part of a legal settlement and was authorized by the United  
States District Court for the Northern District of California.

- The Gmail Team

The settlement acknowledges that we quickly changed the service to address  
users' concerns. In addition, Google has committed $8.5 million to an  
independent fund, most of which will support organizations promoting  
privacy education and policy on the web. We will also do more to educate  
people about privacy controls specific to Buzz. The more people know about  
privacy online, the better their online experience will be.

Just to be clear, this is not a settlement in which people who use Gmail  
can file to receive compensation. Everyone in the U.S. who uses Gmail is  
included in the settlement, unless you personally decide to opt out before  
December 6, 2010. The Court will consider final approval of the agreement  
on January 31, 2011. This email is a summary of the settlement, and more  
detailed information and instructions approved by the court, including  
instructions about how to opt out, object, or comment, are available at  
http://www.BuzzClassAction.com.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
This mandatory announcement was sent to all Gmail users in the United  
States as part of a legal settlement and was authorized by the United  
States District Court for the Northern District of California.

Gmail is built on the idea that email can be intuitive, efficient, and
useful. And maybe even fun.

Labels instead of folders
Labels do the work of folders with an extra bonus: a conversation can have
several labels, so you're not forced to choose one particular folder. Learn

 Archive instead of delete
You shouldn't ever have to throw things away. Archiving moves messages out
of your inbox and into "All Mail," so they don't clutter your inbox but
remain searchable in case you ever need them again. Learn
more<http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answere76&hl=en&utm_source=wel-eml&utm_medium=eml&utm_campaign=en>

 Conversation view
Gmail groups emails and their replies in your inbox, so you always see your
messages in the context of your conversation. Related messages are stacked
neatly on top of each other, like a deck of cards. Learn

- The Gmail Team
Google rarely contacts Gmail users via email, but we are making an  
exception to let you know that we've reached a settlement in a lawsuit  
regarding Google Buzz (http://buzz.google.com), a service we launched  
within Gmail in February of this year.

Shortly after its launch, we heard from a number of people who were  
concerned about privacy. In addition, we were sued by a group of Buzz users  
and recently reached a settlement in this case.

The settlement acknowledges that we quickly changed the service to address  
users' concerns. In addition, Google has committed $8.5 million to an  
independent fund, most of which will support organizations promoting  
privacy education and policy on the web. We will also do more to educate  
people about privacy controls specific to Buzz. The more people know about  
privacy online, the better their online experience will be.

Just to be clear, this is not a settlement in which people who use Gmail  
can file to receive compensation. Everyone in the U.S. who uses Gmail is  
included in the settlement, unless you personally decide to opt out before  
December 6, 2010. The Court will consider final approval of the agreement  
on January 31, 2011. This email is a summary of the settlement, and more  
detailed information and instructions approved by the court, including  
instructions about how to opt out, object, or comment, are available at  
http://www.BuzzClassAction.com.

The settlement acknowledges that we quickly changed the service to address  
users' concerns. In addition, Google has committed $8.5 million to an  
independent fund, most of which will support organizations promoting  
privacy education and policy on the web. We will also do more to educate  
people about privacy controls specific to Buzz. The more people know about  
privacy online, the better their online experience will be.

Just to be clear, this is not a settlement in which people who use Gmail  
can file to receive compensation. Everyone in the U.S. who uses Gmail is  
included in the settlement, unless you personally decide to opt out before  
December 6, 2010. The Court will consider final approval of the agreement  
on January 31, 2011. This email is a summary of the settlement, and more  
detailed information and instructions approved by the court, including  
instructions about how to opt out, object, or comment, are available at  
http://www.BuzzClassAction.com.

This mandatory announcement was sent to all Gmail users in the United  
States as part of a legal settlement and was authorized by the United

<p>Gmail is built on the idea that email can be intuitive, efficient, and
useful. And maybe even fun.</p>

<p>
<font size="+1">Labels instead of folders</font>
<br />
Labels do the work of folders with an extra bonus: a conversation can have
several labels, so you're not forced to choose one particular folder.

You shouldn't ever have to throw things away. Archiving moves messages out of
your inbox and into "All Mail," so they don't clutter your inbox but remain
searchable in case you ever need them again.

Gmail groups emails and their replies in your inbox, so you always see your
messages in the context of your conversation. Related messages are stacked

Google rarely contacts Gmail users via email, but we are making an  <br />
exception to let you know that we've reached a settlement in a lawsuit  <br />
regarding Google Buzz (http://buzz.google.com), a service we launched  <br />
within Gmail in February of this year.<br />
<br />
Shortly after its launch, we heard from a number of people who were  <br />
concerned about privacy. In addition, we were sued by a group of Buzz users  <br />
and recently reached a settlement in this case.<br />
<br />
The settlement acknowledges that we quickly changed the service to address  <br />
users' concerns. In addition, Google has committed $8.5 million to an  <br />
independent fund, most of which will support organizations promoting  <br />
privacy education and policy on the web. We will also do more to educate  <br />
people about privacy controls specific to Buzz. The more people know about  <br />
privacy online, the better their online experience will be.<br />

Just to be clear, this is not a settlement in which people who use Gmail  <br />

included in the settlement, unless you personally decide to opt out before  <br />
December 6, 2010. The Court will consider final approval of the agreement  <br />
on January 31, 2011. This email is a summary of the settlement, and more  <br />

The settlement acknowledges that we quickly changed the service to address  
users' concerns. In addition, Google has committed $8.5 million to an  
independent fund, most of which will support organizations promoting  
privacy education and policy on the web. We will also do more to educate  
people about privacy controls specific to Buzz. The more people know about  
privacy online, the better their online experience will be.

Just to be clear, this is not a settlement in which people who use Gmail  
can file to receive compensation. Everyone in the U.S. who uses Gmail is  
included in the settlement, unless you personally decide to opt out before  
December 6, 2010. The Court will consider final approval of the agreement  
on January 31, 2011. This email is a summary of the settlement, and more  
detailed information and instructions approved by the court, including  
instructions about how to opt out, object, or comment, are available at  
http://www.BuzzClassAction.com.

This mandatory announcement was sent to all Gmail users in the United  
States as part of a legal settlement and was authorized by the United  
States District Court for the Northern District of California.
